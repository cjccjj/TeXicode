16.2 Math symbols 
LaTeX provides almost any mathematical or technical symbol that anyone
uses. For example, if you include $\pi$ in your source, you will get the
pi symbol π. See the “Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List” package at
https://ctan.org/pkg/comprehensive.
Here is a list of commonly-used symbols. It is by no means exhaustive.
Each symbol is described with a short phrase, and its symbol class,
which determines the spacing around it, is given in parenthesis. Unless
said otherwise, the commands for these symbols can be used only in math
mode. To redefine a command so that it can be used whatever the current
mode, see \ensuremath.
