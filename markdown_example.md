This is an in line latex equation $ Q = mc \delta t $, using single dollars.
This is an in line latex equation $ Q = mc \delta t \sqrt a $, using single dollars, but its got a square root.
This is another in line latex equation \( Q = mc \delta t \), using round brackets.
This is another in line latex equation \( Q = mc \delta t \frac12 \), using round brackets, but its got a fraction.

Below is a latex block using double dollars:
$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \\
e \approx 2.71828
$$
and in square brackets
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac y x)
\]
and in round brackets
\(
x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \\
x = \phi \text{or} \psi
\)
