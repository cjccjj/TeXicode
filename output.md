Here's how to solve this special relativity problem, considering both Earth and the spaceship as observers:

**1. Earth as the Observer (Inertial Frame)**

*   **Distance to P:** 3.0 light-years
*   **Speed:** 0.60c (where c is the speed of light)

*   **Time to reach P (from Earth's perspective):**

```
      𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒   3.0light-years          
𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒=╶────────╴=╶──────────────╴=5.0years
       𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑         0.60𝑐               
```

*   **Time to return to Earth (from Earth's perspective):**

    Since the distance and speed are the same, the return time is also 5.0 years.

*   **Total time for the round trip (from Earth's perspective):**

```
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒=5.0years+5.0years=10.0years
```

**2. Spaceship as the Observer (Inertial Frame)**

We need to account for time dilation (时间膨胀). Time dilation is a phenomenon where time passes slower for an object moving at a relativistic speed relative to a stationary observer.

*   **Time dilation factor (Lorentz factor, 洛伦兹因子):**

```
       1     
γ=╶─────────╴
    ┌──────╴ 
    │   𝑣²   
    │1-╶──╴  
   ╰┘   𝑐²   
```

    Where:

    *   v is the relative velocity between the spaceship and Earth (0.60c)
    *   c is the speed of light

```
          1              1          1       1       
γ=╶───────────────╴=╶─────────╴=╶───────╴=╶───╴=1.25
    ┌────────────╴    ┌──────╴    ┌────╴   0.8      
    │   (0.60𝑐)²     ╰┘1-0.36    ╰┘0.64             
    │1-╶────────╴                                   
   ╰┘      𝑐²                                       
```

*   **Time taken to reach P (from spaceship's perspective):**

    Due to time dilation, the time experienced by the spaceship will be shorter than the time observed from Earth.

```
               𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒                          
                   ᴱᵃʳᵗʰ   5.0years          
𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒ₛₚₐ𞁞ₑₛₕᵢₚ=╶─────────╴=╶────────╴=4.0years
                   γ         1.25            
```

*   **Time taken to return to Earth (from spaceship's perspective):**

    Similarly, the return time is also 4.0 years.

*   **Total time for the round trip (from spaceship's perspective):**

```
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒=4.0years+4.0years=8.0years
```

**Answer:**

The time taken for the total journey to and from P as measured by an observer in the spaceship is 8.0 years.
